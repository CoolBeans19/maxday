Happy birthday, Max! I deeply appreciate everything you've ever done for Hack Club, the surrounding community, and me. Thanks to you, thousands of people across the world know how to code, and feel welcome in a large community to support them. Thanks also for taking such great care of me that night last April when I crashed on your couch while Zach was out of town. Here's to another great year üçª You're the best!
