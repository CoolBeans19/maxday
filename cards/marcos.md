# Happy birthday Max! âœ¨
Thanks for everything you have done for the whole time you've been in Hack Club. You were always available when something went wrong in my club or when I needed help with some project that I couldn't figure out myself. I really appreciate that I can have someone like you to ask for advice when I need it. Enjoy your day and have fun!
