# HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX! ðŸ™ŒðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚
###### (yes, caps-lock was intentionally left on)

Youâ€™re 22 nowâ€¦I think?

Aside from that, I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s been a year already. Youâ€™ve taught me a lot since then, whether it be during those hour-long calls or those long exchanges on Slack past midnight. Many thanks for replying to all my requests for help with code and general advice to normal teenager problems ðŸ˜›.

Your sleep schedule is also the craziest Iâ€™ve ever heard ofâ€”grinding for 24 hours and then crashing for 12 is both a remarkable and frightening feat. Please regulate your sleep schedule, because itâ€™s _very_ important!

It was awesome to finally meet you in-person last month at Los Altos Hacks. Thanks for telling me what hackathons are really aboutâ€”I didnâ€™t know what they were really for before that. We only hung out for a dayâ€”not enough time in my opinionâ€¦that definitely needs to be changed. Iâ€™ll most likely travel to SF this summer, so Iâ€™m really looking forward to having an unforgettable time then!

Also, hereâ€™s a picture of you meditating:
