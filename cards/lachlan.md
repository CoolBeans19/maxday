Max, I hope you're having an awesome day, because you totally deserve it. 

Your work at Hack Club is critical, and you do an amazing job every day. The
rest of the team sees a fraction of what you do for the organization. Deep
gratitude is most certainly in order here‚Äîand cake üç∞

I can't wait to meet you‚Äîjust two months, I hope! For now, a huge happy
birthday. You're totally fabulous.

Lachlan
